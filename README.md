Eclipse SmartHome now hosts the Orange implementation of a standard OSGi EnOcean base driver!

Orange today contributes to Eclipse SmartHome open source project (http://eclipse.org/smarthome), which is a reference in the Smart Home developer ecosystem. Orange considers Eclipse SmartHome as a key project from the overall eclipse IoT program in the open source initiatives of the Internet of Things. Orange implementation of OSGi standard EnOcean Device service specification is now available and maintained on eclipse SmartHome git repository (https://github.com/eclipse/smarthome/tree/master/protocols/enocean) under eclipse public licence (https://www.eclipse.org/legal/epl-v10.html). The implementation of an OSGi Device Service specification is called an OSGi base driver. The specification is officially a chapter of OSGi Release 6 Residential specification (http://www.osgi.org/Release6/HomePage). A base driver simplifies the development of applications controlling devices of a specific protocol, here the EnOcean standard radio technology (https://www.enocean-alliance.org).
